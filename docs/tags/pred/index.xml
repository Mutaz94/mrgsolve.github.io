      <description>Introduction This post introduces a new formal code block for writing models where there are no compartments. The block is named after the analgous NONMEM block called $PRED. This functionality has always been possible with mrgsolve, but only now is there a code block dedicated to these models. Also, a relaxed set of data set constraints have been put in place when these types of models are invoked.
 Status The functionality in this vignette can only be access from the GitHub version.</description>
