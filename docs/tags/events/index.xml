      <description>Introduction This post is to introduce modeled interventions in mrgsolve. The main use case is to force mrgsolve to advance the system to a specific time so that some aspect of the system can change at that time. This is similar to the MTIME functionality that NONMEM provides. Doses (bolus or infusions) can also be implemented as a modeled event. These events are “modeled” because they originate from code in the $MAIN block, not the input data set, so that the events can be reactive to model parameters or the state of the model itself.</description>

      <description>library(mrgsolve) library(dplyr) Introduction Event objects are simple ways to implement PK dosing events into your model simulation.
 Setup Let’s illustrate event objects with a one-compartment, PK model. We read this model from the mrgsolve internal model library.
mod &amp;lt;- mread(&amp;quot;pk1cmt&amp;quot;, modlib(), end=216, delta=0.1)  Events Events are constructed with the ev function
e &amp;lt;- ev(amt=100, ii=24, addl=6) This will implement 100 unit doses every 24 hours for a total of 7 doses.</description>

      <description>library(mrgsolve) library(dplyr) Input data sets An important mechanism for creating robust, complex simulations is the input data set. Input data sets specify the population of individuals to simulate, including the number of individuals, each individual’s dosing interventions, each individual’s covariate values etc. The input data set is just a plain old R data.frame, but with some expectations about which columns are present and expectations for how to handle columns for certain names.</description>
